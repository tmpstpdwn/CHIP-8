# CHIP-8 Emulator

A simple, functional CHIP-8 emulator written by me as a learning project. It supports most CHIP-8 programs.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This emulator does **not** support sound output.


## Screenshots


## Dependancies

To compile the code you would need raylib library installed as it uses raylib for renderer.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository && Build:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tmpstpdwn/CHIP-8
    cd CHIP-8
    make
    ```

2. Use the keyboard to control the game. Default CHIP-8 keypad mapping:

    ```
    1 2 3 C
    4 5 6 D
    7 8 9 E
    A 0 B F
    ```

    Mapped to:

    ```
    1 2 3 4
    Q W E R
    A S D F
    Z X C V
    ```
