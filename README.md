# CHIP-8 Emulator

A simple, functional CHIP-8 emulator written by me as a learning project. It supports most CHIP-8 programs.

> ⚠️ **Note**:
> - This is a standard CHIP-8 implementation and does not support SUPER-CHIP or XO-CHIP ROMS!!!.
> - This implementation doesnt support sounds.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and build:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tmpstpdwn/CHIP-8
    cd CHIP-8
    make
    ```

2. Run the emulator with a ROM:

    ```bash
    ./chip8 path/to/rom.ch8
    ```

3. Keyboard controls:

    CHIP-8 uses a 4×4 hexadecimal keypad:

    ```
    1 2 3 C
    4 5 6 D
    7 8 9 E
    A 0 B F
    ```

    Mapped to your keyboard as:

    ```
    1 2 3 4
    Q W E R
    A S D F
    Z X C V
    ```
